This is the link to my World's Worst Calculator: https://sandra-krejcir.github.io/theWorstCalculator/;

P.S. I know I only have 1 commit- that is because stupid me forgot about GitHub until the last moment when everything was done... Basically, I remebered GitHub when I needed the link to the page :)

Oh, yeah, and I couldn't for the life of me make the 'round number to' option work.
